Revision history for Giddy

{{$NEXT}}
	- Now using MQUL for document matching and updating (MQUL was extracted
	  from Giddy and released on CPAN independently)
	- Now using Moose instead of Any::Moose as for some reason I've
	  had some problems.
	- Created Giddy::Collection::FileSystem as the class that represents
	  real collections, and turned Giddy::Collection into a Moose role,
	  as for some reason Moose was giving me weird problems with inheritance
	- Fixed bugs when traversing real collections
	- Removed all Giddy::Role::* classes, moved them directly into their
	  appropriate consuming classes (every role was only consumed by
	  one class so there wasn't any real reason for them)
	- Created Giddy::Database::_is_collection() to make checking faster,
	  also _is_collection(), _is_document_dir() and _is_static_dir()
	  also perform _is_directory() automatically.

	- Fixed bugs when traversing documents in a Giddy::Collection object
	  (i.e. not a Giddy::Collection::InMemory object), namely moved the
	  "_loaded" attribute to Giddy::Collection and removed references
	  to the "_query" attribute when dealing with Giddy::Collection
	  objects and not Giddy::Collection::InMemory objects

	- Finding a document by name is now much faster when the query is for
	  an exact name (i.e. _name => 'asdf' or _name => { '$eq' => 'asdf }),
	  very important when collection has a lot of documents
	- When loading documents, they now also have a _coll attribute with
	  the path of the collection in which they reside
	- The 'cached' attribute in Giddy::Collection should be built lazily
	- Added some more info to the docs

0.012_004 2011-04-21 03:24:38 Asia/Jerusalem
	- Fixed small errors in the manual

0.012_003 2011-04-20 21:09:39 Asia/Jerusalem
	- Changed how repo creation is made as Git::Repository::create()
	  is now deprecated
	- Forcing usage of Git::Repository version 1.18 and above due to
	  above change
	- Fixed small errors in the docs

0.012_002 2011-04-03 22:31:25 Asia/Jerusalem
	- Added support for child documents and made the whole child collection/document
	  a bit clearer by adding "_has_many" and "_has_one" to every document
	  loaded
	- Updated manual with new sections on child collections and documents
	- Fixed bugs with _list_files and _list_dirs in PathAnalyzer (used the
	  "map" function instead of "grep" accidentally)

0.012_001 2011-03-31 19:32:12 Asia/Jerusalem
	- Added support for static file directories
	- Removed unnecessary use of File::Util in Giddy::Collection
	- Refixed bug with empty-expression greps, this time by simply calling find()
	  when query string is empty
	- Giddy now never looks in the working directory in order to analyze the
	  database, only in the Git index
	- Added a get_collection() method to Giddy::Collection that gets child
	  collections
	- Created Role::PathAnalyzer and Role::PathMaker to modularize anything
	  having to do with analyzing and creating paths in the database
	- Renamed the mark() method to stage() as it's closer to the Git nomenclature
	- Root path is now the empty string so paths never start with a starting
	  slash, this makes the code much simpler
	- Not using File::Spec anymore
	- This is now purely Unix software
	- Updated manual and documentation with new changes

v0.11.0   2011-03-22 00:38:52 Asia/Jerusalem
