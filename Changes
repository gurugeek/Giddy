	  a bit clearer by adding "_has_many" and "_has_one" to every document
	  loaded
	- Updated manual with new sections on child collections and documents
	- Fixed bugs with _list_files and _list_dirs in PathAnalyzer (used the

0.012_001 2011-03-31 19:32:12 Asia/Jerusalem
	- Added support for static file directories
	- Removed unnecessary use of File::Util in Giddy::Collection
	- Refixed bug with empty-expression greps, this time by simply calling find()
	  when query string is empty
	- Giddy now never looks in the working directory in order to analyze the
	  database, only in the Git index
	- Added a get_collection() method to Giddy::Collection that gets child
	  collections
	- Created Role::PathAnalyzer and Role::PathMaker to modularize anything
	  having to do with analyzing and creating paths in the database
	- Renamed the mark() method to stage() as it's closer to the Git nomenclature
	- Root path is now the empty string so paths never start with a starting
	  slash, this makes the code much simpler
	- Not using File::Spec anymore
	- This is now purely Unix software
	- Updated manual and documentation with new changes
