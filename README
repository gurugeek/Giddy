NAME
    Giddy - Schema-less, versioned media/document database based on Git.

SYNOPSIS
            use Giddy;

            my $giddy = Giddy->new;

            my $db = $giddy->get_database('/path/to/database');

DESCRIPTION
    WARNING: THIS IS ALPHA SOFTWARE, RELEASED FOR TESTING PURPOSES ONLY. DO
    NOT USE IT ON A PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENT YET. IT'S INCOMPLETE, BUG-RIDDEN,
    LIKELY TO CHANGE, AND WILL RUN OVER YOUR CAT.

    Giddy is a schema-less (as in NoSQL), versioned database system for
    Unix-like operating systems, built on top of Git. A database in Giddy is
    simply a Git repository, providing the database with automatic,
    comprehensive versioning and distributive capabilities.

    As opposed to most modern database systems, Giddy aims to be human
    editable. One can create/edit/delete database entries with nothing but a
    text editor and some simple git commands (YAML has been chosen as the
    serialization format since YAML is well suited as a human editable
    format; however, JSON support is planned). This module provides an API
    for usage by Perl applications.

    Main database features (not all features implemented yet):

    *   Human editable

    *   Multiple version concurrency

    *   Concurrent transactions

    *   Distributed peers

    *   Disconnected operation

    *   Consistent UTF-8 encoding

    *   Other fancy words

    STOP: This document (and all other module documentation provided with
    the distribution) are for reference purposes only. Please read
    Giddy::Manual before using Giddy to learn about the database system and
    how to use it.

CLASS METHODS
  new()
    Creates a new instance of this module.

OBJECT METHODS
  get_database( $path )
    Returns a Giddy::Database object tied to a Git repository located on the
    file system. Please provide full path names to prevent potential
    problems.

    If the path doesn't exist, Giddy will attempt to create it and
    initialize it as a Git repository. It will also create an empty file
    called ".giddy" inside the database and perform an initial commit. You
    can safely remove that file after that.
